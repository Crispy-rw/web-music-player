This web application allows the user to upload audio files and have them stored in a database.
As of right now, when the server is killed the files are gone. But the browser can be closed without losing any data.

The core of this app is built around nodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and GridFS.
To use, clone the repo to your local host, and set the following environment variables
MONGO_USER ,MONGO_PASSWORD, MONGO_DB_NAME and PORT.

All features of this application are in an experimental state, so any and all errors should be expected.
