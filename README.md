My idea for this assignment is to create a music library that stores the audio files in a database.
The functionality will include searching, filtering, playing, and potentially uploading.

If it comes down to it, we can at least provide the ability to add a file based on it's url.
I am not sure yet what goes in to adding a file from the localhost.

There are three main sections to this web application.

1. The front end design: I imagine a simple 'itunes classic' interface. Maybe album art.
2. The Express base file server: Each song will be a json object with appropriate fields, and a source url that points to a the mongodb.
3. Mongo database: node.js needs to interface with the database.

Much of the interface/UX can be done with handlebars. Which we haven't learned yet. The MongoDB stuff will be covered last week of class, but it's actually pretty simple,. youtube has a ton of tutorials. 

For now be thinking creatively and researching methods to implement basic features of a media player. I fully expect to encounter problems that force us to simplify our application.
