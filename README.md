My idea for this assignment is to create a music library that stores the audio files in a database.
The functionality will include searching, filtering, playing, and potentially uploading.

If it comes down to it, we can at least provide the ability to add a file based on it's url.
I am not sure yet what goes in to adding a file from the localhost.

There are three main sections to this web application.

1. The front end design: I imagine a simple 'itunes classic' interface. Maybe album art.
2. The Express base file server: Each song will be a json object with appropriate fields, and a source url that points to a the mongodb.
3. Mongo database: node.js needs to interface with the database.


I will post any useful articles or resources I find below this comment line
