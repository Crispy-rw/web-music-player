HTML/css
  The main page is listTemplate.handlebars, and each song is built using the trackTemplate.handlebars partials.
  1. An artist handlebars template to display only songs by one artist.
  2. A filterBox template, just like the benny's list template, but without city, price etc.
  3. A addSong modal, also like benny's list.
  4. CSS that works just like benny's list and makes things look nice.

Client JS
  1. interactive filterBox
  2. interactive modal
  3. use handlebars template to add new song to page
  4. use XMLHttpRequest to send POST req to the server, like the people pictures website
  5. ???

Server JS
  1. add POST req functionality
  2. switch to MongoDB served content
  3. ???

Lets all chip away at this list, don't worry if stuff doesn't all work together.
I don't mind connecting everything at the end to make it all work.
